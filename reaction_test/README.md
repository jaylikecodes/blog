# Reaction Speed Test Game

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based game that measures and records the user's reaction speed. Users click as quickly as possible when the screen changes to a specific color, measuring their reaction time. Through 5 tests, the best record is measured and can be saved to an online leaderboard.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
-   **Additional Libraries**: None (Vanilla JS)

## Developer Comments and Review

**Analysis of Current Implementation Status:**

1.  **Strengths:**
    * Core game mechanics are well-implemented.
    * Appropriate visual/auditory feedback for user experience.
    * Modular code structure is conducive to maintenance.
    * Multilingual support is well-implemented.

2.  **Areas for Improvement:**
    * **Mobile Optimization:** The current code is optimized for desktop environments; improvements are needed for touch event handling and responsive design on mobile devices.
    * **Performance Optimization:** Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` for accurate timing measurement.
    * **Accessibility:** Accessibility improvements such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support are needed.
    * **Loading Optimization:** Initial loading time can be improved by lazy loading Firebase modules or loading them only when needed.
    * **Offline Support:** Consider implementing an offline mode using service workers.

3.  **Security Considerations:**
    * Strengthen database security through Firebase rules configuration.
    * Server-side validation is needed to prevent leaderboard data manipulation.
    * Consider using environment variables to prevent API key exposure.

4.  **Scalability Suggestions:**
    * Add various game modes (e.g., continuous click mode, pattern recognition mode).
    * Add personal record tracking by integrating user accounts.
    * Implement social media sharing functionality.
    * Consider a multiplayer feature to compete with friends.
